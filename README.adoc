# Install any npm controlled libs (probably need to firstly run: shadow-cljs compile app )
npm install

# To make shadow-cljs directly available on to the command line...
#     npm install shadow-cljs

# Compile a build once and exit
shadow-cljs compile app

# Compile and watch (the resulting webapp will be at http://localhost:3000 )
shadow-cljs watch app

# Connect to REPL for the build (available while watch is running)
shadow-cljs cljs-repl app

# Build a release-build that is optimized for production use
shadow-cljs release app

# Then run it
python3 -m http.server 3000 --directory public
